# Intro to Bash Scripting:

This is the folder for some basic bash scripts. There are different subdirectories here for different levels of difficulty. 

## Achtung 
Some of the bash scripts here start with:  
\#! /bin/bash

The top line of your bash script should be the result that you get from the command:  
**where bash**
