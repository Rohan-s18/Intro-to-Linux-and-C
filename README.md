# Intro to Linux, C and Scripting

## Author: **Rohan Singh** 

This repository is divided into three main components, each with a different purpose, depending on what you want to do. All of these directories have their respective mddules that range from absolute rookies to experienced veteran. This can be helpful if you are in an OS, Scripting, Embedded Design or Compilers class, or maybe you just want some prep for an interview.  

## Linux  
Contains a collection of Linux commands and what they do and how to use the Linux shell. These commands are in sheets ranging in different levels of difficulty.  

This folder contains:  
  - Commands
  - Guides and Manuals  
  - Basic Scripts (more advanced ones can be found in the Scripting section)



## C  
This directory contains multiple modules for the C Programming language. These modules range from absolute rookie mode with no C programming experience to advanced code in C.  

This directory contains the following modules:    
  - **Kernighan Ritchie:** Basic C programs are from Kernighan, Ritchie's *Intro to C programming language*. http://cslabcms.nju.edu.cn/problem_solving/images/c/cc/The_C_Programming_Language_%282nd_Edition_Ritchie_Kernighan%29.pdf  
  - **Intermediate C Programming:** This module contains slightly more intermediate C programs, you can use this as a refresher, if you have already coded in C before and just need to get up to date.
  - **C Programming in OS:** This module contains source code for multithreading, shared memory and mutex thread locking ettcetera. This module is inclined more towards using system calls than the others.    
  - **Advanced C Programming:** This module contains slightly advanced C code.  

## Scripting  
This section contains scripts that would make your life a lot easier, this includes simple bash and awk scripts. I think at this point you know how this repository is, you'll find modules if you're an absolute rookie in the field of scripting, to slightly more practical and useful scripts.   

**The Bash scripts include:**  
   - **Basics:** This is an intro to Bash Scripting. This module goes through the very basics of bash scripting, these scripts don't really have any practical use, but act as the foundation to writing Bash Scripts.  
   - **Intermediate Scripts:** This is the second level of Bash Scripting, with more practical uses.  

**The awk scripts include:**  
  - **Lol haven't started yet**
