//  This code will illustrate to you how to make LinkedLists using Structs in C++

//  Imports
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cstdio>


//  This Struct is a singly LinkedList :)
struct Node{
    
    //The pointer to the next Node
    Node* next;
    
    //The value stored in the Node
    char* name;
    
    //This method will insert the new node after this one
    void insert(Node* new_node){
        //Setting the next of the new Node to 'this' node's next
        new_node->next = next;
        
        //The next of 'this' node is now the new_node
        next = new_node;
    }
    
};

//  This method will demonstrate traversing through a LinkedList
void traverse(){
    
    //Instantiating the Node objects
    Node n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6;
    
    n1.name = "Rohan";
    n2.name = "Alessandra";
    n3.name = "ZoÃ«";
    n4.name = "Alden";
    n5.name = "Emile";
    n6.name = "Mariel";
    
    //In order to insert a node after the current, you will need to pass the reference to the next
    n1.insert(&n2);
    n2.insert(&n3);
    n3.insert(&n4);
    n4.insert(&n5);
    n5.insert(&n6);
    
    //Creating a traversal node pointer that will start at the head of the LinkedList
    Node* trav = &n1;
    
    int ct = 1;
    while(trav){
        //Printing the name
        printf("The %dth node of the LinkedList is named: %s\n",ct,trav->name);

        //Moving the traversal node to the next one
        trav = trav->next;
        
        ct++;
    }
    
    
}

//  This method is an extension of the main method
void ll_demo(){
    
    traverse();
    
    printf("\n");
    
}



//  Main method (Uncomment to run)
int main(){
    
    //Runnning the demo method
    ll_demo();
    
    return 0;
    
}
